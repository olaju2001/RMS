## Project Overview

The Resource Management System is a comprehensive Spring Boot-based solution designed to optimize the utilization of renewable energy resources and support energy transition initiatives. This system provides real-time monitoring, analysis, and management of renewable energy sources, helping organizations maximize efficiency while reducing their environmental impact.

## Documentation
- [Technical User Guide](docs/TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md) - Detailed implementation guide, API documentation, and development setup

## Problem Statement

Organizations face several challenges in managing renewable energy resources:
- Inefficient resource allocation and utilization
- Lack of real-time visibility into energy consumption patterns
- Difficulty in predicting and responding to energy demand fluctuations
- Complex integration with existing power grid systems
- Limited ability to make data-driven decisions for energy optimization

## Implemented Solution

Our microservices-based system addresses these challenges through:

1. Real-time monitoring and visualization of energy resources
2. Predictive analytics for energy consumption and generation
3. Automated alert system for resource optimization
4. Integration with external weather systems
5. Comprehensive reporting and analytics dashboard
